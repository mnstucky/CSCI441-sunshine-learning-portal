CSCI 441: Software Engineering - Repository for Sunshine Learning Portal

# Quick Start Guide
To get started:
    1. Clone the repository. Navigate to the desired directory in a terminal and clone the repository with the command, git clone https://github.com/mnstucky/CSCI441-sunshine-learning-portal.git
    2. Install Node.js (version 14.15.4 LTS or newer) and NPM.
    3. In the repository's local directory, run the command, npm install
    4. Again in the repository's directory, run the command, npm run dev. This will start the Express server, which will restart every time you make changes to the project's code (you'll still need to refresh your browser to see any changes).
